# Autonomous_Vehicles
Projects and reports developed during the Autonomous Vehicles course at Politecnico di Milano focused on path planning algorithms and autonomous navigation in simulation. The first project involved implementing RRT, RRT-Connect, and Informed RRT*, comparing them with A* in terms of performance and optimality on various maps. The second project addressed full-pipeline navigation in Gazebo with TurtleBot3, including SLAM-based mapping, trajectory planning, and closed-loop control using ROS and Simulink. Additional assignments explored low-level control, path tracking, FSMs, and visual servoing, with detailed analysis and documentation provided in the reports.
